## Introduction
PyMatlab is a collection of Python scripts and modules that cover a wide range of mathematical topics. Each module is designed to be self-contained, providing not only the implementation but also examples and explanations to facilitate learning and application.

## Features
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, decompositions.
- **Calculus**: Differentiation, integration, Taylor series.
- **Statistics**: Probability distributions, statistical tests, data analysis tools.
- **Geometry**: Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, transformations, distance calculations.
- **Number Theory**: Prime numbers, factorization, modular arithmetic.
- **Discrete Mathematics**: Graph theory, combinatorics, algorithms.

## Installation
To use PyMatlab, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each module in PyMatlab is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your projects. Below is a simple example of how to use a module from PyMatlab:

```python
from pymatlab.linear_algebra import matrix_multiplication

A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

result = matrix_multiplication(A, B)
print("Matrix Multiplication Result:", result)
```

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation within each module.

## Examples
In the `examples` directory, you will find various Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating how to use different modules of PyMatlab. These examples are intended to provide a hands-on learning experience.

## Contributing
